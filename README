express-form is a very simple web forum written in Javascript using Node and the Express node web framework. It is a reimplementation of my flask-forum software, written to learn Node.

TODO

 - CSRF tokens. I'd like this to be built into the forms library.
 - XSS protection in forms. When a form field has a value auto filled (after a validation error), the value is not safely escaped when the form is rendered. 


How to run

You will need:
Node, npm (the Node package manager), sqlite3

Download a copy of this repo:
git clone git@github.com:tdryer/express-forum.git
cd express-forum

Install my fork of the forms library from here:
npm install https://github.com/tdryer/forms/tarball/master

Use npm to install other dependencies:
npm install -d

Create the database:
sqlite3 forum.db < schema.sql

Run the application using Node:
node app.js

Visit localhost:3000 in a browser. The default account has username/password tom/tom.
